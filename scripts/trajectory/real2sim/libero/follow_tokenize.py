"""Scheme D on LIBERO -- re-execute recorded human demos as 15-token atomic rollouts.

Input is the regenerated LIBERO demos (``<task>_demo.hdf5``, one ``data/demo_k`` per demo,
with the FULL MuJoCo state per step). LIBERO-plus's training set is exactly these demos
re-rendered under ~10 visual perturbations (verified action-for-action), so following them
covers the LIBERO-plus trajectories one-to-one.

Per demo:

1. The demo's TCP pose track and object positions are read straight from its recorded
   states (``LiberoBackend.pose_from_state``, no rendering).
2. The track is split at gripper events; each segment is reduced to 6-D corners -- RDP on
   position plus a keyframe every ``rot_key_deg`` of orientation change.
3. The scene is restored from ``states[0]`` and the corners are chased with single-axis
   tokens (``TokenEpisode.chase_pose``): translations in 2 cm, rotations in 10 deg. Every
   stored frame is a state the discrete controller actually reached.
   A GRASP is placed where the demo's fingers FINISHED closing, not where the close
   command started: a human keeps pushing down and sideways while the fingers travel
   (measured over 10 spatial demos: 0.5-4.9 cm down and 0.7-3.7 cm sideways in the ~13
   closing steps), while the follower stops and then closes. Grasping at the command
   pose closed on air in 6 of 10 pilot episodes.
   And the grasp is defined RELATIVE TO THE OBJECT: the hand's offset from the carried
   object at that moment, re-applied to where the object actually is (see grasp_target). The absolute hand pose
   is not enough -- by the time a human's fingers stop, the object has been dragged ~2 cm
   toward the hand, so copying the demo's hand coordinates lands 1-2 cm off an object that,
   for the follower, never moved (measured: hand-object offset 20 mm off with a 1 mm TCP
   error).
   The lattice is ANCHORED on that grasp: before the first frame, the hand is servoed
   (unrecorded, < 1 cm per axis -- less than LIBERO's own start-pose spread) so the grasp
   point is a whole number of 2 cm steps away. Otherwise the lattice alone leaves up to
   1 cm per axis between the reachable node and the grasp point.
4. Before each RELEASE the carried object is steered to where the DEMO put it (the object
   whose position changed most between the demo's grasp and release) -- the follower's
   grasp offset differs from the demo's, so replaying the demo's hand pose would place the
   object off by that offset (the ManiSkill lesson: 3/6 -> 12/12 once retargeted).
5. After the last RELEASE the hand lifts clear, the scene settles, and the episode is kept
   only if LIBERO's own success predicate holds.

``--mode simplified`` keeps what the demo KNOWS and drops what it merely DID. Measured on
40 spatial episodes in ``full`` mode: 52% of rotation tokens cancel an opposite one on the
same axis, 147 of 264 happen while carrying a (round) bowl, and translation runs up to 34%
longer than the key poses require. Wobbles a human never meant, which a per-image policy
cannot explain from the frame -- label noise, extra decisions, and a wrist view tilted away
from the real-robot data. So, for PICK-AND-PLACE segments only (the grasped object moves
>= ``--pick-min-move-m`` before release):

* approach: turn the wrist to the demo's grasp orientation FIRST, in place, then XY at a
  safe height, then straight down onto the object-centric grasp pose -- no demo corners;
* transport: leave the pick site the way the demo did (its displacement up to the moment
  it had moved ``--site-radius-m`` sideways -- not straight up: out of a drawer a human
  backs off first), cross at the higher of the demo's two SITE clearance heights (leaving
  the pick site / arriving over the place site; not its peak height, which on the
  cabinet-top task put the far end of the carry out of reach), turn by the demo's net wrist
  change (per world-axis component >= ``--rot-deadband-deg`` only) over the placement, go
  down to the demo's arrival height, then the usual retarget + descent. Every waypoint is
  aimed by the carried OBJECT, not the hand.

OPEN-HAND CONTACT (a drawer hooked and pulled, a plate pushed -- no GRASP anywhere: all 42
libero_goal "open the middle drawer" demos keep the fingers open) is detected from the demo's
states instead of its gripper events: an articulated joint moving, or an object moved >= 3 cm,
while the gripper is open (an object moved only while another was pushed -- knocked by it --
is not an action). Such a demo runs as a timeline of actions, and the contact actions are
CONSTRUCTED from the scene, not replayed from the human's hand: the demo says only which
part, which way, how far. Replaying the hand did not survive the discrete controller -- the
human hooks a drawer handle by its back-top edge and keeps it there by turning the wrist
while pulling (a fixed-orientation pull rides over after 2-5 cm), drags the top drawer by
friction from on top of its handle, and moves the plate by fingers caught in its centre;
with every fix it reached 7/10 on the middle drawer and 0/5 on the other two (plan doc,
section 10). Built from the scene, with only the 15 tokens:

* a drawer (slide joint): turn so the fingers point at the cabinet, opened across the handle
  bar (:func:`handle_grasp`), come in level from in front of it, GRASP the bar, whole tokens
  along the joint axis to the demo's travel, RELEASE, back off along the pull;
* a push: axis by axis in the demo's order, from OUTSIDE low behind the object where the
  hand's footprint is free, else from INSIDE with the fingers down in the rim and re-engaged
  whenever it stops following (:func:`push_engagement`); corrections for what drifted.

A pick later in such an episode is not the anchored key pose, so its grasp node is rounded
DOWN (deeper); after a drawer is opened the hand comes down clear of the drawer and slides in
over the object, drags the object out from under it before lifting, and places into it at
its floor's centre (:func:`timeline_approach`, :func:`clear_of_drawer`,
:func:`drawer_place_shift`). Every constructed orientation is the one of its two mirror
images nearer the episode's start (``r_home``): consecutive 90 deg turns otherwise added up
to 170 deg and the arm threw the TCP 24 cm.

The GRASP orientation itself is never deadbanded: it is part of what the demo knows. And
every turn happens where the arm is folded, never at full reach: turning 30 deg of pitch at
the far end of an XY run threw the TCP up 20 cm on LIBERO's OSC. All simplified chases stop
when they stop making progress (``TokenEpisode.chase_pose(progress_patience=...)``).

Everything the demo says ABOUT THE TASK is kept -- which object, the grasp point and
approach side, where it is placed, the order of events, the carry height. GRASPED contact
segments (a knob held and turned: the grasped object does not move) are followed in full,
since there the path IS the skill. ``--fallback-full`` re-runs a failed simplified episode
in full mode, so the success predicate decides which details were necessary.

Besides the teleop-layout rollout, each episode stores ``states.npz`` (the sim state behind
every frame) and ``final/`` (one frame AFTER success, for a DONE sample that does not reuse
the last action frame). ``libero/rerender.py`` turns the states into visually-perturbed
copies without re-executing anything.

            The hand goes just behind the part's contact point, fingers straight down and
            opened across the push so it is thin along it, and pushes. For a hinge the
            contact is the part's longest lever (:meth:`lever_of`) and the direction its
            tangent (axis x radius), both recomputed every token because they turn with the
            part (a microwave door swings 102 deg). For a drawer being closed it is the
            handle, straight in. Pushing beats grasping the handle there: the bottom drawer
            sits so low that reaching its handle put the arm's link6 into the wine rack.
